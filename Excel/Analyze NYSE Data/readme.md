# Kaggle's New York Stock Exchange S&P 500 dataset
In this project we will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. 
I draw a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. 

## Files: 

The project contains three different folders for each task. The files are excel files with a quick analysis on a .pptx document. As they are safe, I invite you to download them to check my work. 

## Tasks:

### Task 1:

a. Identify the question about the data that you will answer based on your data analysis. Your question should include at least one categorical variable (GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry) and one quantitative variable (one of the financial metrics) and require the use of at least one of the summary statistics. A tab within the Excel spreadsheet that you submit should include the summary statistics [measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and measures of spread (standard deviation and range)] you used to answer your question.

b. Create a presentation that provides at least one visualization to help with your answer. This visualization might be a bar chart, histogram, scatterplot, box-plot or other visual that you learned to make. Include your insights from the measures of center and spread and at least one numeric summary statistic in the description.

### Task 2:
Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list. Your drop-down list should pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement. The P&L statement should include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.

### Task 3:
Create a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) of your choice that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case). Your assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin and operating margin should change for each scenario.
