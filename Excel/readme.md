# Excel projects 

Excel is a wonderful can allow you to do wonderful things with data. Most of the time, especially in the field of Business Analytics, most companies do not have other softwares to perform their analysis. It is important to learn how to use it as it is the main technology used. 

The projects in this section will be related to the field of Business Analytics: finance, marketing, sales, supply chain and demand, etc. 

Despite the analysis, some projects will also contain predictive analytics and will be posted in this section and in the [Predictive Analytics](https://github.com/LoicChamplong/Predictive-Analytics-For-Business) part of my Github account as well.
